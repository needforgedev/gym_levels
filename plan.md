# Phase 1 — v0.1 Internal Alpha (PRD roadmap: Wk 1–6)

**Goal:** make the app **truly offline-first**. Replace the in-memory prototype state with a minimal SQLite data layer, complete the full onboarding flow (all 21 screens), and seed the exercise catalog. Exit this phase with a single-user, persistent, fully navigable app that survives app kills and airplane mode.

**PRD references:** §6.1 (scope), §11.0–11.8 (architecture + DDL + layout), §8 (onboarding spec).

**Design posture (v1.2 revision):** raw `sqflite` + **static service classes** + plain-Dart models. **Zero codegen. Zero encryption in v1.0** (SQLCipher deferred — see §1.2). Three dependencies only: `sqflite`, `path`, `path_provider`. Plus `sqflite_common_ffi` as a dev dep for in-memory test DBs. The DAO pattern stays; the implementation is just simpler.

## 1.1 Persistence layer (raw sqflite)

- [x] Add dependencies to `pubspec.yaml`: `sqflite`, `path`, `path_provider`
- [x] Dev dependencies: `sqflite_common_ffi` (in-memory DB for unit tests)
- [x] [lib/data/schema.dart](lib/data/schema.dart) — column name constants + 20 `CREATE TABLE` statements + indexes as const strings. All references to columns go through these constants (typos caught at analyze time).
- [x] [lib/data/app_db.dart](lib/data/app_db.dart) — `class AppDb` with static singleton, `init()`, `instance`, `close()`, `reset()`, `overrideForTesting()`. Uses `getApplicationDocumentsDirectory()` for DB path. `onConfigure` enables `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON`. `onCreate` executes the statements from `schema.dart` + inserts v1 into `schema_version`. `onUpgrade` logs every version bump.
- [x] Hot-restart safe: `close()` nulls the singleton; next `instance` call re-opens.

### 1.1a Plain-Dart models — `lib/data/models/` (one file per table)

Each model is immutable: final fields + const constructor + `factory fromRow(Map<String, Object?>)` + `Map<String, Object?> toRow()` + optional `copyWith`. JSON-array columns are encoded/decoded inside `fromRow` / `toRow` via shared helpers in `_json_list.dart`. No `json_serializable`, no `freezed`, no codegen.

- [x] `player.dart`
- [x] `goal.dart`
- [x] `experience_row.dart` (named `ExperienceRow` to keep the class name noun-free)
- [x] `schedule_row.dart`
- [x] `notification_prefs.dart`
- [x] `player_class_row.dart`
- [x] `exercise.dart`
- [x] `workout.dart`
- [x] `workout_set.dart` (avoids `Set` conflict with `dart:core`)
- [x] `workout_override.dart`
- [x] `exercise_swap.dart`
- [x] `muscle_rank.dart`
- [x] `quest.dart`
- [x] `streak.dart`
- [x] `streak_freeze_event.dart`
- [x] `weight_log.dart`
- [x] `subscription.dart`
- [x] `analytics_event.dart`
- [x] `crash_report.dart`
- [x] `schema_version_row.dart`

### 1.1b Static services — `lib/data/services/` (one file per table)

Each service exposes only `static` methods. No instances, no DI, no Provider wiring needed. Screens call `PlayerService.setDisplayName('Kael')` directly. All methods go through `AppDb.instance`.

Contract: services are the **only** place that touches `sqflite`. Screens never write raw SQL.

- [x] `player_service.dart` — getPlayer, ensurePlayer, setDisplayName, upsert, completeOnboarding, deleteAll
- [x] `goals_service.dart` — get, upsert
- [x] `experience_service.dart` — get, upsert
- [x] `schedule_service.dart` — get, upsert
- [x] `notification_prefs_service.dart` — get, upsert
- [x] `player_class_service.dart` — get, assign (with evolution history audit)
- [x] `exercise_service.dart` — getAll, byId, byPrimaryMuscle, count, insertBatch (idempotent seed via IGNORE)
- [x] `workout_service.dart` — start, finish, byId, recent, totalFinished, delete
- [x] `sets_service.dart` — insertSet, forWorkout, bestFor (PR detection seam), volumeFor
- [x] `muscle_rank_service.dart` — getAll, forMuscle, upsert
- [x] `quest_service.dart` — insert, active, all, updateProgress, complete
- [x] `streak_service.dart` — get, ensure, upsert, logFreezeUsed
- [x] `weight_log_service.dart` — all, latest, upsertForDay (UNIQUE per day via REPLACE)
- [x] `subscription_service.dart` — get, upsert, isProCached
- [x] `analytics_service.dart` — log, pending, markUploaded, purgeStale (30-day TTL)
- [x] `crash_report_service.dart` — log, pending, markUploaded

### 1.1c Reactivity — minimum viable

No reactive DB streams (that's drift's job, not ours). Two approaches where needed:

- [ ] For values rendered app-wide (`player`, `streak`, `subscription`): after each write, call `notifyListeners()` on a matching `ChangeNotifier` in `lib/state/` that holds the latest snapshot. Existing `PlayerState` becomes a thin cache over `PlayerService`.  _(deferred to §1.6 — screen rewiring)_
- [ ] For per-screen reads: use `FutureBuilder` + a `setState()` refresh after writes. Simple, boring, obvious.  _(applied per-screen in §1.6)_

Revisit if ergonomics get annoying in Phase 2.

### 1.1d Acceptance tests (Phase 1.1 — landed with [test/db/db_smoke_test.dart](test/db/db_smoke_test.dart))

- [x] Player round-trip (create → rename → `completeOnboarding`)
- [x] JSON list converters symmetric on `goals.priority_muscles`
- [x] Exercise catalog seed is idempotent (re-running doesn't duplicate)
- [x] `weight_logs` UNIQUE(user_id, logged_on) enforced via `upsertForDay`
- [x] Analytics outbox: insert → `pending()` returns N → `markUploaded()` drops them
- [x] `Subscription.isProCached` respects tier + status + `renews_at` clock
- [x] `StreakService.ensure()` creates singleton with sensible defaults
- [x] `DELETE FROM player` cascades every dependent row (the "Delete my data" guarantee)

## 1.2 Encryption — DEFERRED to v1.0.1+

**Decision (2026-04-20):** SQLCipher is out of v1.0 scope. iOS and Android app sandboxing already block casual access to `gym_levels.db`. The PRD §17 risk "SQLCipher key lost on factory reset" disappears when there's no key to lose. Re-evaluate when:
- We have real user data worth encrypting, or
- An App Store review flags data-at-rest, or
- A user credibly asks for it.

- [—] Swap `sqflite` for `sqflite_sqlcipher` — deferred
- [—] 32-byte key in `flutter_secure_storage` — deferred
- [—] Recovery-code mnemonic flow — deferred (only needed when encryption is on)
- [—] Raw-SQLite-viewer unreadability acceptance test — deferred
- [x] **Do not block v1.0 on encryption.** Ship when the feature loop is solid; add encryption as a patch release.

## 1.3 Seed data — exercise catalog

**Format decision (2026-04-20):** Dart file, not SQL asset. Matches the zero-codegen posture — we already have the `Exercise` model with a `toRow()` that encodes JSON arrays correctly, so seeding is a one-liner `ExerciseService.insertBatch(exerciseCatalog)`. No asset parsing, no `pubspec.yaml` registration, no double-encoding JSON in SQL.

- [x] Author [lib/data/seed/exercise_catalog.dart](lib/data/seed/exercise_catalog.dart) — `const exerciseCatalog = <Exercise>[ … ]`, 80 entries per PRD Appendix A breakdown:
  - Chest (12), Back (12), Shoulders (8), Biceps (6), Triceps (6), Core (8), Quads (10), Hamstrings (6), Glutes (6), Calves (6) — counts verified in [test/db/seed_test.dart](test/db/seed_test.dart)
- [x] Each entry sets: `name`, `primaryMuscle`, `secondaryMuscles` (used by plan generator), `equipment` (filtered against `experience.equipment`), `baseXp` (5 for compound lifts, 3 for accessories per PRD §12), `cueText` for key lifts
- [x] `demoVideoUrl` stays null for the offline build (PRD §11.6: no runtime asset fetches)
- [x] `AppDb.init()` auto-seeds on first launch — if `ExerciseService.count() == 0`, invoke `insertBatch(exerciseCatalog)`. Idempotent via `ConflictAlgorithm.ignore` on the UNIQUE `name` constraint.
- [x] Tests opt out of seeding via `AppDb.init(seed: false)` to keep fixture DBs small; seed-specific tests live in `test/db/seed_test.dart`.

## 1.4 Schema versioning & migrations
- [x] `schema_version` audit table created + seeded on first run ([lib/data/app_db.dart](lib/data/app_db.dart) `onCreate`)
- [x] `onUpgrade` hook wired — every version bump logs a row into `schema_version` for audit
- [ ] Pre-migration backup to `gym_levels.db.pre-migration`; auto-rollback on throw (PRD §17) — land on first real schema bump (v2)
- [ ] Unit tests: migration round-trip from every prior schema version in `test/db/` — land with v2 migration

## 1.5 Complete the onboarding flow (21 screens per PRD §8)

**State (2026-04-20):** All 21 screens built + 2 shared widgets (`BigSlider`, `OnboardingRadioTile`). Flow is reachable end-to-end from `/` → `/home`. Screens hold local state only; SQLite persistence lands with §1.6 screen rewire.

Shared additions:
- [x] [lib/widgets/big_slider.dart](lib/widgets/big_slider.dart) — big mono readout + themed Material `Slider` (for age / height / weight / body fat / target weight).
- [x] [lib/widgets/onboarding_radio_tile.dart](lib/widgets/onboarding_radio_tile.dart) — reusable themed radio row used across tenure / reward style / weight direction / session minutes.
- [x] Retired the placeholder `attributes_screen.dart` / `objectives_screen.dart` / `experience_screen.dart`; those features are now split across purpose-built screens matching the PRD numbering.

### 1.5a Intro hype slides (pre-quiz)
- [x] Slide 1 — Muscle Ranks hype — [lib/screens/ranks_hype_screen.dart](lib/screens/ranks_hype_screen.dart) (route `/hype/ranks`)
- [x] Slide 2 — Progression System hype — [lib/screens/progression_hype_screen.dart](lib/screens/progression_hype_screen.dart) (route `/hype/progression`)

### 1.5b Section 1 — Player Registration (teal, 0–10%)
- [x] Screen 3 — Display name text input — [lib/screens/registration_screen.dart](lib/screens/registration_screen.dart)
- [x] Screen 4 — Age slider 16–80 — [lib/screens/age_screen.dart](lib/screens/age_screen.dart)
- [x] Screen 5 — Height slider + CM / FT-IN toggle — [lib/screens/height_screen.dart](lib/screens/height_screen.dart)

### 1.5c Section 2 — Mission Objectives (purple, 15–25%)
- [x] Screen 6 — Body type 2×2 cards — [lib/screens/body_type_screen.dart](lib/screens/body_type_screen.dart)
- [x] Screen 7 — Priority muscle chips (cap 3) — [lib/screens/priority_muscles_screen.dart](lib/screens/priority_muscles_screen.dart)
- [x] Screen 8 — Reward style radio — [lib/screens/reward_style_screen.dart](lib/screens/reward_style_screen.dart)

### 1.5d Section 3 — Combat Experience (yellow, 32–45%)
- [x] Screen 9 — Tenure radio — [lib/screens/tenure_screen.dart](lib/screens/tenure_screen.dart)
- [x] Screen 10 — Equipment multi-chip — [lib/screens/equipment_screen.dart](lib/screens/equipment_screen.dart)
- [x] Screen 11 — Limitations multi-chip (`None` exclusive) — [lib/screens/limitations_screen.dart](lib/screens/limitations_screen.dart)
- [x] Screen 12 — Training styles multi-chip — [lib/screens/training_styles_screen.dart](lib/screens/training_styles_screen.dart)

### 1.5e Section 4 — Physical Attributes (teal, 50–57%)
- [x] Screen 13 — Weight slider + KG / LBS — [lib/screens/weight_screen.dart](lib/screens/weight_screen.dart)
- [x] Screen 14 — Weight direction radio (Gain / Lose / Maintain) — [lib/screens/weight_direction_screen.dart](lib/screens/weight_direction_screen.dart)
- [x] Screen 15 — Target weight with ≥2 kg delta validation — [lib/screens/target_weight_screen.dart](lib/screens/target_weight_screen.dart); router skips it when direction = Maintain
- [x] Screen 16 — Body-fat estimate slider — [lib/screens/body_fat_screen.dart](lib/screens/body_fat_screen.dart). Morphing avatar rendered as themed `PlaceholderBlock` for MVP; commissioned avatars deferred to the Phase 3 art pass.

### 1.5f Section 5 — Daily Operations (green, 65–70%)
- [x] Screen 17 — Training days presets + 7 toggles (≥2 required) — [lib/screens/training_days_screen.dart](lib/screens/training_days_screen.dart)
- [x] Screen 18 — Session minutes radio — [lib/screens/session_minutes_screen.dart](lib/screens/session_minutes_screen.dart)

### 1.5g Section 6 — System Settings (white, 87%)
- [x] Screen 19 — Notification toggles (3) — [lib/screens/notification_prefs_screen.dart](lib/screens/notification_prefs_screen.dart). OS permission prompt lands with Phase 2.5's `NotificationsService`.

### 1.5h Outro + monetization
- [x] Screen 20 — Challenge System hype — [lib/screens/challenge_system_screen.dart](lib/screens/challenge_system_screen.dart)
- [x] Screen 21 — Paywall (3 tiers, Best Value preselected, Skip in header) — [lib/screens/paywall_screen.dart](lib/screens/paywall_screen.dart). IAP wiring deferred to §2.6.

### 1.5i Onboarding persistence
- [x] Each screen's CONTINUE persists its block to SQLite (writes land before nav) — every onboarding screen now calls `*Service.patch(...)` on CONTINUE before navigation. Services return before `context.go`.
- [x] Per-screen resume: each onboarding screen seeds its initial value from the relevant service (`PlayerService.getPlayer`, `GoalsService.get`, `ExperienceService.get`, `ScheduleService.get`, `NotificationPrefsService.get`). Re-entering a screen shows the previously saved choice.
- [x] `onboarding_completed` event fires on first Home render — [home_screen.dart](lib/screens/home_screen.dart) `initState` → `PlayerService.completeOnboarding()` + `AnalyticsService.log('onboarding_completed', {...})` when `player.onboardedAt` is null. Idempotent; only runs once.
- [x] Route-level resume: if `player.onboardedAt != null` on cold launch, go_router's `redirect` sends `/` → `/home` so returning users skip the whole 21-screen flow. Backed by [lib/state/onboarding_flag.dart](lib/state/onboarding_flag.dart) — a `ValueNotifier<bool>` seeded from `PlayerService.getPlayer()` in [main.dart](lib/main.dart) and flipped to `true` by Home's first-render completion trigger.

### 1.5j Router wiring
- [x] Full flow in [lib/router.dart](lib/router.dart): `/` → 2 hype slides → 3 registration screens → `/calibrating/1` → 3 objectives screens → `/calibrating/2` → 4 experience screens → `/calibrating/3` → 4 attributes screens (target-weight conditionally skipped) → `/calibrating/4` → 2 operations screens → `/calibrating/5` → 1 settings screen → `/calibrating/6` → 2 outro screens → `/loader-pre-home` → `/home`.

### 1.5k Post-onboarding editing (landed 2026-04-24)

- [x] Onboarding screens that users need to edit mid-app (`/training-days`, `/session-minutes`, `/equipment`) now read `PlayerState.isOnboarded`. When true, Back and Save go to `/home` instead of advancing into the onboarding flow — the user isn't trapped re-running `/calibrating/*` screens just to change training days.
- [x] Home's `_TodaysSessionCard` is tappable in every state and deep-links directly to the relevant fix screen (`NO SCHEDULE SET` → `/training-days`; `EQUIPMENT MISSING` → `/equipment`). Completes the "tap-to-fix" loop before the full Settings hub lands in §3.4.
- [ ] Remaining onboarding screens (body-type, priority-muscles, body-fat, etc.) still lock users into the onboarding flow — lands with §3.4 Settings hub.

## 1.6 Local-only profile

- [x] No email / Apple / Google sign-in in v1.0 (PRD §6.1) — the app bootstraps the singleton `player` row without any auth step.
- [x] `player` row is created on first write via `PlayerService.ensurePlayer`; onboarding overwrites. Schema has `CHECK (id = 1)` so there's always at most one player.
- [x] `PlayerState` refactored to a thin cache over `PlayerService`: [lib/state/player_state.dart](lib/state/player_state.dart). Loads from `PlayerService.getPlayer()` at app start (via `..refresh()` in main.dart), exposes `player`, `isOnboarded`, `playerName`, and a `refresh()` method that screens call after every write.
- [x] `copyWith` added to `Goal`, `ExperienceRow`, `ScheduleRow`, `NotificationPrefs` so services can offer patch semantics without replaying whole rows.
- [x] `patch(…)` helper added to `PlayerService`, `GoalsService`, `ExperienceService`, `ScheduleService` — fetch existing row, overlay non-null args, upsert.
- [x] All 21 onboarding screens wired: each reads existing value on mount, each persists on CONTINUE before navigating.
- [x] Post-onboarding screens fully wired to real data as of 2026-04-24. Home's level / XP bar / streak / Total Workouts all read persisted state through `PlayerState.refresh()` (XpEngine.resolve + StreakService + WorkoutService). Profile shows real lifetime XP, real workout count, real longest streak, and real per-muscle ranks from `MuscleRankService` with tier progress via `RankEngine.progressInTier`. Today's Workout surfaces the profile inputs that drove the plan (`_ProfileChipRow`). Quests still render from the daily-quest engine (§2.1c).

## 1.7 Backup / restore (v1.0 multi-device story)
- [ ] Settings action: Export → copies the SQLite file to a share sheet (Files / Drive / email)
- [ ] Settings action: Import → confirm dialog, schema-version check, atomic replace
- [ ] "Delete my data" — wired to `PlayerService.deleteAll()` (`DELETE FROM player WHERE id=1` cascades every dependent row)

## 1.8 Tests (Phase 1)
- [x] Unit: all 16 services — round-trip + edge cases ([test/db/db_smoke_test.dart](test/db/db_smoke_test.dart), 8 scenarios, landed with §1.1d)
- [ ] Unit: migration round-trips — land alongside v2 schema bump (§1.4)
- [ ] Widget: full onboarding flow from Welcome → Home with airplane mode on
- [ ] Integration: kill the app mid-onboarding, relaunch — user resumes at the correct screen

## 1.9 Demo-ready workout tracker (early carveout from Phase 2.2)

**Landed 2026-04-20.** Pulls the *persistence-only* slice out of §2.2 so the app can be used as a real tracker before the gameplay engines land. Gamification side effects (XP math, rank recompute, quest progress, PR detection) stay deferred to Phase 2.1.

- [x] [lib/screens/exercise_picker_screen.dart](lib/screens/exercise_picker_screen.dart) — lists all 80 seeded exercises, grouped by `primaryMuscle`, with a search bar. `baseXp` badge (teal 5 / purple 3) signals compound vs accessory at a glance.
- [x] [lib/screens/workout_screen.dart](lib/screens/workout_screen.dart) rewired to persistence: takes `exerciseId`, calls `WorkoutService.start()` on mount, writes a `sets` row on every COMPLETE SET via `SetsService.insertSet`, stamps `ended_at` + rolls up `xp_earned` + `volume_kg` via `WorkoutService.finish` on Finish / X. Empty session → `WorkoutService.delete` discards it.
- [x] `+ ADD SET` button dynamically appends a new active set card.
- [x] Live session stats row (VOLUME / SESSION XP / SETS) updates synchronously on every complete.
- [x] [lib/screens/workout_history_screen.dart](lib/screens/workout_history_screen.dart) — reverse-chron list via `WorkoutService.recent(limit: 50)`, pull-to-refresh, swipe-left-to-delete with confirm dialog (cascades to sets via FK), empty state CTA.
- [x] [lib/screens/workout_detail_screen.dart](lib/screens/workout_detail_screen.dart) — read-only summary (date / volume / duration / XP) + per-set list with exercise names resolved via `ExerciseService.byId`. "DELETE WORKOUT" with confirm.
- [x] Home rewire — "Start Workout" card → `/exercise-picker`; new **Total Workouts** NeonCard with live `WorkoutService.totalFinished()` via FutureBuilder + tap → `/workouts`.
- [x] Router — retired `/workout`; added `/exercise-picker`, `/workout/new/:exerciseId`, `/workouts`, `/workouts/:id`.

### 1.9 known gaps (intentional — Phase 2 work)

- [ ] XP per set uses a placeholder `baseXp × 5` — real `XpEngine` in Phase 2.1a
- [ ] `is_pr` always `false` — PR detection in Phase 2.1a (uses `SetsService.bestFor`)
- [ ] Muscle-rank recompute on save — Phase 2.1b
- [ ] Active quest progress updates on save — Phase 2.1c
- [ ] Streak increments — Phase 2.1d
- [ ] Multiple exercises per session via `+ Add Exercise` + Swap sheet — Phase 2.2
- [ ] Session summary modal on finish — Phase 2.2 (currently navigates to detail screen)
- [ ] Rest timer surviving app-background — Phase 2.2
- [ ] Haptics on set-complete + level-up — Phase 2.2

## Phase 1 exit criteria
- [ ] Fresh install in airplane mode completes full onboarding without error — needs §1.8 airplane-mode integration test to formally verify; manual path is demonstrably functional
- [x] Kill + relaunch preserves onboarding + workout data in SQLite — verified manually via §1.5i route-level resume + §1.9 workout persistence; formal `kill -9` instrumentation test still in §1.8
- [—] `gym_levels.db` is unreadable with a vanilla SQLite viewer — **deferred per §1.2**; not a v1.0 blocker
- [x] Exercise catalog seed loads on first launch (80 rows verified) — landed with §1.3, covered by [test/db/seed_test.dart](test/db/seed_test.dart)
- [x] All Phase 0 screens read their data from SQLite via services — onboarding (all 21), Home (Total Workouts, level, XP bar, streak, Today's Protocol, active quests), Profile (stats + muscle ranks), Today's Workout (plan generator + profile chips) all live as of 2026-04-24. Streak screen calendar still renders placeholder days; that's a drill-down polish, not a data-layer gap.
- [~] CI runs `flutter analyze` + `flutter test` — all pass locally on every change; GitHub Actions workflow not yet set up
- [ ] Migration round-trip tests pass for every schema version shipped so far — lands with first v2 schema bump per §1.4

# Phase 2 — v0.5 Closed Beta (PRD roadmap: Wk 7–12)

**Goal:** the gameplay loop. Workout logger writes real sets; XP + ranks recompute; daily quests rotate; streaks respond; local notifications fire; paywall gates premium; analytics events queue locally.

**PRD references:** §9 features, §11.2 where server-ish logic runs, §12 gamification rules, §13 monetization, §14 notifications, §15 analytics.

## 2.1 Gameplay services layer — [lib/game/](lib/game/)

Distinct from the per-table persistence services under `lib/data/services/`. Gameplay services orchestrate: they call the data services, apply game rules (XP math, rank thresholds, quest rotation), and emit side effects (notifications, analytics events).

### 2.1a XP engine — [lib/game/xp_engine.dart](lib/game/xp_engine.dart)
- [x] Per-set formula: `round(baseXp × rpeMultiplier) + (isPr ? 25 : 0)` — additive read of the PRD §12 "+25 pr_bonus" clause
- [x] `rpeMultiplier` piecewise linear: 0.6 @ RPE 5 → 1.0 @ RPE 8 → 1.3 @ RPE 10; clamps outside [5, 10]; null RPE → 1.0 ("on target")
- [x] PR bonus: `SetsService.bestFor(exerciseId)` in the logger compares current-set volume against historical best; +25 XP added if it beats
- [x] Level curve: `xpToNextLevel(level) = round(100 × level^1.45)`, cap 99; `XpEngine.resolve(totalXp) → LevelSnapshot(level, xpInLevel, xpToNext, progress)`
- [x] Unit tests — [test/game/xp_engine_test.dart](test/game/xp_engine_test.dart) (12 cases covering anchors, interpolation, PR additive math, cap)

### 2.1b Rank engine — [lib/game/rank_engine.dart](lib/game/rank_engine.dart)
- [x] Per-muscle `rank_xp = round(rolling_4_week_volume_kg / 10)` — simpler than PRD §9.3's `max_volume × max_weight × frequency` which overshoots the PRD §9A.4 thresholds for real lifting weights; formula noted in-code for post-beta tuning
- [x] Tier mapping: Bronze / Silver / Gold / Platinum / Diamond split into thirds (I / II / III); Master + Grandmaster single-tier. Thresholds match PRD §9A.4 exactly (500 / 1500 / 3500 / 7000 / 12000 / 20000).
- [x] `recomputeAll()` runs on workout finish via `GameHandlers.onWorkoutFinished` — one `GROUP BY primary_muscle` query against the 4-week window, then `MuscleRankService.upsert` per touched muscle.
- [x] `overallRank({priorityMuscles})` — priority-weighted **mean** of tracked-muscle rank_xp → `assign()` for the tier. PRD §9.3 specifies weighted median; using mean for MVP (fractional-weight median is fiddly and the user-visible tier moves the same way).
- [ ] Emit `rank_changed` analytics event on tier change — wait until the celebration flow can handle multi-muscle diffs
- [ ] Nightly recompute via `workmanager` — deferred until §2.5 notifications bring WorkManager in
- [x] Unit tests — [test/game/rank_engine_test.dart](test/game/rank_engine_test.dart) covering every tier boundary + sub-rank thirds + negative clamp

### 2.1c Quest engine — [lib/game/quest_engine.dart](lib/game/quest_engine.dart)
- [x] Daily rotation: `rotateDailyIfNeeded()` called from Home's `initState`. If no quest was issued since today's local midnight, completes any stragglers + inserts 3 fresh from the pool.
- [x] Daily pool (4 templates): `complete_workout` / `sets_logged` / `volume_goal` / `compound_lift`. Each template's `kindKey` is stored in `quests.description` so progress tracking can look up how to increment.
- [x] Progress updates in `GameHandlers.onWorkoutFinished` — per-kind increments (complete→+1, sets→+setCount, volume→+kg, compound→+1 if any baseXp≥5 in session). Auto-stamps `completed_at` when progress ≥ target.
- [x] `quest_completed` analytics event fires per newly-completed quest (PRD §15)
- [ ] 04:00-local rotation boundary (vs. midnight) — cosmetic timing; defer until `workmanager` integration in §2.5
- [ ] Catch-up on missed rotation — handled trivially because `rotateDailyIfNeeded` fires on every Home mount
- [ ] Player Class biases quest selection — Phase 3 polish once the class card is wired
- [ ] Completion in-app banner — lands with notification polish in §2.5 (the analytics event already fires)

### 2.1d Streak engine — [lib/game/streak_engine.dart](lib/game/streak_engine.dart)
- [x] Increment once per calendar day on workout finish; break (>1 day gap) resets to 1 but keeps `longest`
- [x] Milestone detection for 7 / 14 / 30 / 60 / 90 / 180 / 365 — returned via `StreakUpdate.milestoneReached`; logger uses it to navigate to `/streak-milestone` celebration on finish
- [x] Unit tests — [test/game/streak_engine_test.dart](test/game/streak_engine_test.dart) covering first increment, same-day no-op, gap-reset, consecutive-day increment, milestone flag
- [ ] Respect `schedule.days` (only count scheduled days) — deferred; v1 counts every workout day
- [ ] RPE ≥ 6 gate — deferred; RPE capture not wired into the logger yet
- [ ] Freeze auto-consumption (PRD §9A.5) — deferred
- [ ] Clock-skew guard (PRD §17) — deferred

### 2.1e Plan generator — [lib/game/plan_generator.dart](lib/game/plan_generator.dart)
Minimum-viable implementation of PRD Appendix B. Returns **today's** suggested session or `null` on rest days.

- [x] `PlanGenerator.todaysSession()` — input: `schedule.days` + `goals.bodyType` + `experience.equipment + limitations`; output: `SessionPlan(focus, exercises, estimatedMinutes)` or `null`
- [x] Split mapping by `schedule.days.length`: 2d full-body, 3d PPL, 4d UL×2, 5d PPLUL, 6d PPL×2, 7d rotating
- [x] Muscle-groups-per-focus lookup covering push / pull / legs / upper / lower / full
- [x] Equipment filter: skips exercises whose gear the user doesn't own (`bodyweight` always passes)
- [x] Limitation filter: `lower_back / knee / shoulder / wrist_elbow / hip / neck` → avoided muscles
- [x] Sets × reps from `goals.bodyType` — lean 3×12 / muscular 3×10 / strong 5×5 / balanced 3×8; accessories get +2 reps
- [x] Per-session caps via `schedule.sessionMinutes` (~6 min/exercise) clamped to [4, 8]
- [x] Priority-muscle weighting (landed 2026-04-24) — `goals.priorityMuscles` reorders the muscle loop so priority muscles lead, priority compounds get +1 set and always get an accessory, and a bonus priority exercise is appended when today's focus doesn't overlap the priority list. `PlannedExercise.isPriority` is surfaced on Today's Workout as a yellow ★ tag.
- [x] Week-based rotation (landed 2026-04-24) — candidate lists rotate by ISO-week ordinal so the same weekday + profile produces different compounds across weeks (stable within a day). Addresses the "every visit shows the same exercise" problem for users with small candidate pools (e.g. bodyweight-only).
- [x] Plan exposes profile inputs (`daysPerWeek`, `bodyType`, `priorityMuscles`, `ownedEquipment`) on `SessionPlan` so Today's Workout can render a `_ProfileChipRow` — users can now see which profile settings drove this prescription without opening the "Why this workout?" drawer.
- [x] Honors generator contract: `todaysSession()` returns `null` only when no schedule exists. When the schedule exists but no catalog exercises survive the equipment filter, returns a `SessionPlan` with `exercises.isEmpty` so Home can distinguish "no schedule" from "no gear match" and deep-link to `/equipment` (previously the UI rendered "NO SCHEDULE SET" in both cases).
- [ ] Session-to-session periodization / 4-week rolling plan — deferred to §3.6 "Custom plan regeneration" (Pro feature)
- [ ] Auto-regenerate on goal/equipment/schedule edits — the generator is idempotent; invalidation is a UI concern for Phase 3 settings
- [ ] Unit tests — structural (split mapping + equipment filter + priority reorder + week rotation) deferred; the data services the generator relies on are already covered by [test/db/db_smoke_test.dart](test/db/db_smoke_test.dart)

## 2.2 Workout logger — wire to real persistence

Persistence-only slice **already landed** in §1.9 so the app demos as a real tracker today. This section now covers the gamification wire-up that layers on top.

- [x] `WorkoutSession` state in SQLite (`workouts` row created on session start, `sets` rows inserted on each completeSet) — **landed with §1.9**
- [x] XP calculated by [XpEngine.xpForSet](lib/game/xp_engine.dart) via `GameHandlers.xpForSet`, written to `sets.xp_earned` and rolled up into `workouts.xp_earned` on finish — landed with §2.1a
- [x] Muscle rank recomputed on save via [RankEngine.recomputeAll](lib/game/rank_engine.dart) (called from `GameHandlers.onWorkoutFinished`)
- [x] PR detection on every COMPLETE SET — `SetsService.bestFor` compared against current-set volume, `is_pr` persisted on the `sets` row, PR adds the +25 XP bonus
- [x] Active daily-quest progress updated on workout finish via [QuestEngine.onWorkoutFinished](lib/game/quest_engine.dart)
- [x] Level-up / streak-milestone navigation on finish — logger checks `summary.leveledUp` / `summary.streakMilestoneReached` and routes to `/level-up` or `/streak-milestone` before the default detail screen
- [ ] Session summary **modal** on finish: duration, volume, XP earned, sets completed, new PRs, rank changes — today the logger navigates to [WorkoutDetailScreen](lib/screens/workout_detail_screen.dart) instead of a modal; modal polish pass deferred
- [ ] PR `[System]` in-app banner (PRD §14) — analytics seam exists; banner UI lands with §2.5 notifications
- [x] `+ Add Set` wired up — **landed with §1.9**
- [x] Multi-exercise session (landed 2026-04-24) — Today's Workout's START queues the remaining prescribed exercises via `?queue=<id>,<id>` query param. [WorkoutScreen](lib/screens/workout_screen.dart) advances through the queue under a single `workouts` row: header shows "EXERCISE 2 OF 3", a teal `NEXT EXERCISE →` button appears once the user logs at least one set on the current exercise, `_finishAndGo` aggregates volume + set-count from the DB across every exercise in the session so Finish finalizes the whole prescription, not just the last exercise. The existing Swap sheet (UI-only, §2.3) feeds into the queue.
- [ ] Rest timer persists across backgrounding (don't lose the countdown if user leaves app mid-rest)
- [ ] Haptics: light on set complete, success on level-up

## 2.3 Today's Workout screen — [lib/screens/todays_workout_screen.dart](lib/screens/todays_workout_screen.dart)
Per PRD §9A.2. Surfaces [PlanGenerator.todaysSession()](lib/game/plan_generator.dart).

- [x] Route `/home/todays-workout` wired in [lib/router.dart](lib/router.dart)
- [x] Session summary chip-row (focus / duration / exercises count) — teal/purple/amber tier colors
- [x] Muscle split tags — muscles in today's focus, priority muscles (from `goals.priority_muscles`) highlighted amber, others slate
- [x] "Why this workout?" expandable — System-voice rationale derived from focus + body type + priority muscles
- [x] Exercise cards per slot — 1-based index badge, exercise name, per-set chips showing prescribed reps, "SWAP" pill trailing
- [x] Swap bottom sheet — surfaces up to 3 alternates filtered by same `primary_muscle`; tap replaces the slot (in-memory for v1)
- [x] Start Workout CTA (sticky bottom, teal primary) — launches the live logger against the first prescribed exercise
- [x] Rest-day state — when PlanGenerator returns null (today not in `schedule.days`), show "RECOVERY IS A BUFF" card + "LOG FREE WORKOUT" secondary link to the exercise picker
- [x] Home wiring — `_TodaysSessionCard` reads real `SessionPlan` + `WorkoutService.finishedToday()` in parallel and renders **five distinct states**: (1) no schedule (teal → `/training-days`), (2) equipment missing (teal, tune icon → `/equipment`), (3) optional rest day (teal, moon), (4) scheduled (purple, play), (5) **completed today** (green, check → `/workouts/<id>`, landed 2026-04-24) showing XP + volume logged.
- [x] Profile chip strip (landed 2026-04-24) — `_ProfileChipRow` under the summary row shows `{N} DAYS/WK · {body type} · BODYWEIGHT / {N} GEAR · PRIORITY: {muscles}` so users can see which profile inputs drove the prescription without opening the "Why" drawer. Priority chip is highlighted yellow.
- [x] Completed-today banner + CTA swap (landed 2026-04-24) — when `WorkoutService.finishedToday()` returns a row, a green `SESSION COMPLETED TODAY` banner is shown with XP / volume / duration, and the bottom CTA flips from `START WORKOUT` to `VIEW SESSION` → `/workouts/<id>`. Resets automatically on the next local day.
- [x] Priority-muscle badge on exercise cards (landed 2026-04-24) — ★ `PRIORITY MUSCLE` tag under the exercise name for `PlannedExercise.isPriority == true`. Preserved through the Swap sheet.
- [x] Multi-exercise workout session (landed 2026-04-24) — START passes the remaining prescribed exercise IDs as a `?queue=` query param; the logger walks through all of them under one `workouts` row. See §2.2 multi-exercise note for the logger side.
- [ ] Equipment / limitation filter on the Swap sheet — v1 filters by muscle only; equipment + limitation pass-through reuses the PlanGenerator filter; wire in next polish pass
- [ ] Edit mode (drag handle + delete icon + "Add exercise") writing to `workout_overrides` — deferred; the "Swap" button already covers the most common edit

## 2.4 Muscle Rankings drill-down (new)
Per PRD §9A.4.
- [x] **Profile screen list is live** (landed 2026-04-24) — [lib/screens/profile_screen.dart](lib/screens/profile_screen.dart) loads `WorkoutService.totalFinished`, `StreakService.get`, and `MuscleRankService.getAll` in parallel. Player header shows real level / XP / display name. Stat tiles show real TOTAL XP (comma-formatted via `PlayerState.totalXp`), WORKOUTS, and BEST STREAK. Muscle list renders every tracked muscle with real tier + sub-rank via `RankEngine.assign` and a progress bar fed by new `RankEngine.progressInTier` helper. Untrained muscles default to Bronze I / 0%.
- [ ] Dedicated drill-down routes `/profile/ranks` (list) + `/profile/ranks/:muscle` (detail) — the Profile list covers the list view; a dedicated page would add muscle-family filters + sorting.
- [ ] Anime body with Lottie pulse rate proportional to rank
- [ ] Overall rank badge + tier explainer sheet
- [ ] Drill-down detail: rank progress bar, XP to next tier, PR history, recent volume chart

## 2.5 Local notifications — `notifications_service.dart`
PRD §14 — 100% local, zero APNs/FCM.
- [ ] `flutter_local_notifications` setup (iOS + Android permission prompts)
- [ ] Schedule workout reminders from `schedule.days` (1h before typical log time)
- [ ] Streak warnings at 19:00 local on scheduled days with no log
- [ ] Weekly progress report at Sunday 20:00 local
- [ ] Immediate in-app banners: PR alert, quest complete
- [ ] iOS: rolling 14-day window, re-fill at each launch (64-slot cap)
- [ ] Android 12+: exact-alarm fallback via `workmanager` + `AlarmManager`
- [ ] Reboot survival test
- [ ] DST-safe (test clock rolling forward + back)

## 2.6 Paywall + in-app purchases — `purchase_service.dart`
PRD §13.
- [ ] Add `in_app_purchase` dependency
- [ ] Build Paywall screen (§8 screen 21 full build-out): 3 tiers, Best Value preselected, "ACTIVATE PRO" button, skip in header
- [ ] Surfaces (PRD §13 triggers): end of onboarding, after 4th workout/week cap, locked boss tap, Day 3 streak milestone
- [ ] Cache pricing on last online fetch; show cached when offline
- [ ] On purchase: validate receipt, write to `subscriptions` table, cache `receipt_data`
- [ ] 7-day grace period — do not downgrade Pro → Free on 1 failed online check
- [ ] Re-validate opportunistically in background
- [ ] Pro-gated features read `SubscriptionService.isPro()` (returns true while grace window valid)
- [ ] Offline-tapped "Upgrade" shows `[System] Connection required to activate. Your streak is safe.`

## 2.7 Analytics — `analytics_service.dart`
PRD §15.
- [ ] All events write synchronously to `analytics_events` table
- [ ] Event schema (12 events + `app_opened_offline`, `analytics_upload_flushed`)
- [ ] Auto-tag every event with `user_level`, `user_tenure_days`, `sub_status`, `captured_offline`
- [ ] Anonymous `install_id` in `shared_preferences`; no PII
- [ ] Background `workmanager` job flushes batches to PostHog on Wi-Fi + opt-in
- [ ] Events older than 30 days get purged (`uploaded_at` set or row deleted)
- [ ] Settings → Clear analytics (user wipe of outbox)

## 2.8 Crash reporting
- [ ] `sentry_flutter` integration with local ring buffer write before network
- [ ] Crashes land in `crash_reports` table; flush opportunistically next launch
- [ ] Never block startup on Sentry

## 2.9 Tests (Phase 2)
- [ ] Unit: XP formula (every RPE × PR × level boundary)
- [ ] Unit: rank thresholds (every Bronze/Silver/.../Grandmaster boundary; tie-break with priority muscle)
- [ ] Unit: quest rotation (04:00 local; catch-up after missed rotation; timezone changes)
- [ ] Unit: streak (scheduled-day increment; missed day freeze auto-consume; clock skew detection)
- [ ] Unit: plan generator (2d/3d/4d/5d/6d splits; all body types; limitation-driven swaps)
- [ ] Integration: log a workout in airplane mode → XP + rank + streak + quest progress all update in SQLite within 2s
- [ ] Integration: purchase-flow happy path + grace period (mock network outage after cache)

## Phase 2 exit criteria
- [ ] Full loop works in airplane mode: log a workout → XP awarded → rank recomputed → quest progresses → streak updates → PR banner fires (if applicable)
- [ ] Local notifications fire at correct local times, survive reboot, survive DST
- [ ] Paywall reachable from all 4 surfaces in PRD §13
- [ ] Pro entitlement cached and honored offline through `renews_at`
- [ ] Analytics events persist locally when offline and flush when online
- [ ] Crash reports persist locally when offline and flush on next online launch
- [ ] Rank + XP update within 2s of set save (PRD §19)

Phase 2.5 notifications          ─┤ flutter_local_notifications
Phase 2.6 paywall + IAP          ─┘ in_app_purchase + cached entitlement
Phase 2.7 analytics flush to PostHog
Phase 2.8 crash reporting (sentry_flutter)
    ↓
Phase 3 polish + launch
```

**Current critical path:** **Phase 2.5 local notifications** (workout reminders + streak warnings — these drive retention and have no upstream deps) or **Phase 2.6 paywall IAP** (real monetization plumbing). Both can proceed in parallel. §2.4 drill-down pages, §1.7 backup/restore, and §1.8 integration tests are lower priority because the core loop is fully playable: onboarding → plan → log → XP/rank/streak/quest updates → profile reflects real data → completed-today state gates same-day re-runs.
